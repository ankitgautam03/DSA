# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:

```
1) Fork the repo and bring the repo in your local system
2) Create and switch to a separate branch
3) Add DSA related Code or Non-code content that is not present in the repository in appropriate directory
4) Follow all the necessary guidelines and try avoiding any copied content as those requests will not be treated as fair under Hacktoberfest 2022 regulations.
4) Commit and Push your changes
